      <p>In my free time I enjoy doing many different activities. 
        A few of the activities that I do daily are going on runs, cooking with my roommates, and 
        playing with my dog. My roommates and I cook a variety of different meals. We make 
        different types of salmon and chicken. On the side, we sometimes have cooked brussels sprouts with rice.
        Other nights, we will have a caprese salad and cauliflower. </p> 
      
        <p>
        In addition, I love to go to Michigan 
        sporting events. My favorite sporting event is watching Michigan Basketball play. 
        I am hoping that they will be really good this year. This year, I went to my first 
        Michigan Hockey game against Winsconsin with my friends. I also go to all of the 
        Michigan Football home games, which are always a lot of fun. </p>
        
        <p>
          My favorite place is to go into New York City. I love to walk in Central Park, try different 
        restaurants in the city, and go to Broadway Shows. NYC has changed a lot because of COVID-19,
        but its unique character never will. 
        </p>

        With my family and friends, I love to hang out and go to Yankees and Knicks games with them.
