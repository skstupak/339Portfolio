      <h3>Phi Beta Lambda</h3>
      <p>
        At the University of Michigan, I have been involved in 
        many different clubs. I am extremely active in my business
        fraternity, which is Phi Beta Lambda (PBL). In PBL, 
        I have held an officer position where I was Philanthropy Chair.
        As Philanthropy Chair, I organzied events to get the 
        brotherhood more involved. I implemented new fundraisers by building 
        connections with new charities and planned events that 
        the bortherhood would enjoy, elicting the biggest positive impact. 
        I networked for future endeavors by participating in weekly 
        professional events and projects that highlighted the 
        technology, finance, consulting, and marketing industries. 
        I managed a stock portfolio during an investment competition on Investopedia stock stimulator.

      <h2>Challah for Hunger</h2>
      <p>
        I executed the social media presence to promote events where the proceeds raised go to Food Gatherers.
        I educated volunteers about food insecurity on college campuses and ways to help at U-M.
        I devised new events that would rebuild and expand volunteer participation.
      </p>

      <h2>Go Blue Wear Pink</h2>
        <p>
          I connected with companies for sponsorship and arranged social media outreach to raise over $48,000 for breast
          cancer research at the U-M Rogel Cancer Center.
